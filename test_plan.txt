Test plan

Installation: 
To install try using the remotes::install_github("jenper/offers", INSTALL_opts="--install-tests", type='source', force=TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies=TRUE) command.  

To gain a better understanding of how the package works follow the Offer vignette.  

Run tests in the test suite using devtools::test(), there should a test file for every function in the package. 

For each function the expected input and output looks like so: 

format_data: formats the offer files from the EA EMI website https://www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Wholesale/Datasets/BidsAndOffers/Offers to output a data.frame that can be accepted as input for the other functions in the package. 
Arguments can take single file name or path to folder of multiple files. The function mergesthe files to make a single data.frame, removes unneeded columns and returns a data.frame.  
It errors if file contents dont have the right columns or if the path is incorrect. 
To test check using incorrect file inputs and check if outputs are correct.   

anomaly_detect: based on the anomalize package. Accepts offers data as first argument. 
Prints charts showing any anomalies in the data and returns list of anomalies.
To test check using incorrectly formatted data and check if date values are returned. 

report: should print summaries of the other functions in the package so users only need to use this function if they just want to read report.
In order gives summary statistics, offer plot, anomaly_detect plots and gives summary paragraph on if any changes or anomalies were detected. 
To test check using incorrectly formatted data and check if correct plots and summaries are being printed.
